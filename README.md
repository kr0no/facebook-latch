# Facebook Latch

Small PoC to protect a Facebook account with Latch.

**Dependencies:**

* Python

* Mechanize
```
pip install mechanize
```

* LatchSDK
```
pip install latchsdk
```


> ###Disclaimer###
>This is a simple PoC. Code requires several improvements. This software may not work in the future if Facebook Mobile HTML changes. Idea based on [latch-facebook-hack](https://github.com/jaesga/latch-facebook-hack).
